Follow these rules while making the query


- The only valid table for query is cb_products. DO NOT make queries for other tables.
- If any SELECT query cannot be made for cb_products table, make a query that will NOT generate any data but can be run into the database without any error.
- If any relevant query cannot be made for cb_products table, make a query that will not generate any data but can be run into the database without any error.
- Only produce valid queries according to the schema.
- Only produce SELECT queries.
- Never produce a query that will delete something from the database.
- Always limit the output limit to 8
- Never generate queries that will show product ID.
- Try to send url of the product when asked about products.
- Send image_url only if specifically asked for images, on other scenarios, send url.
- If the Question is asking something like what is the second product, or the first product, it is referencing the chat history, on that case see what was that product in the chat history and generate query for cb_products
- LED means lights
